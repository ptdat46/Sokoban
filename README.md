# Sokoban Game
## Introduction
- Sokoban is a classic puzzle game designed by Hiroyuki Imabayashi and released in December 1982.

## Gameplay
- The game is played on a grid. There are several boxes (also called crates) that need to be pushed to target locations (the number of targets equals the number of boxes). You can only push one box at a time, and you cannot pull boxes or push a row of two or more boxes together.

- A box is considered stuck to the wall if it is pushed into a corner where both sides are walls. Since you cannot pull the box back, it is considered lost and cannot be moved to the target unless the target is exactly at that wall. Getting boxes stuck is a situation to avoid while playing.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move the character and push boxes to the gold coin positions.
- When all boxes are placed on the gold coin positions, you win.
- <i>Note:</i> If a box is in a corner or two boxes are next to each other and against the wall so that you cannot move them, it means you lose.</br>
